## Fork overview

My own personal take on things borrowing from many other RPGs and games to make mechanics simpler to understand so you can pick up and play DoomRPG + DoomRLA without looking at a manual.

## Simplified
* On level up you get 5 modules. Each stat increase costs 1 module. Each skill unlock is 1 module per level, ie 2 modules to get skill level 2 etc. This makes it easier to plan out a build as you know exactly how much it costs to grow a stat from 1 -> 10. Just 2 levels at 5 modules a level.



## New Mechanics

## Installing (build)

Below is the download link:
1. [DoomRPG SE Rebalance Last Build (for GZDoom 4.8.2)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lbhGQVh_MXSTBQ-iCmuOIHOE31HREPUE?usp=sharing)

Installation Instructions:

1. The archive has a folder DoomRPG SE Rebalance. Unzip this folder to any location on the drive;
2. Put your doom2.wad in "..\DoomRPG SE Rebalance\DoomRPG-wads". doom2.wad is the main file of the original game. Can buy it in [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/DOOM_II/) market;
3. The archive has a folder Extras, it has screenshots of DoomRPG Launcher with the order of launching modifications (DoomRLA, Lexicon, etc.). Make sure your Load Order in the "Mods" tab of the Launcher matches the screenshots;
4. Run the DoomRPG.exe and click "Launch Doom RPG" to start playing.
