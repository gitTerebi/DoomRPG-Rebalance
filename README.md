## Fork overview

The main goal of this fork is bugfixing/stability & performance improvements. However some usability/gameplay tweaks have been made here and there.
I recommend reading CHANGELOG.txt and the commits for all the changes.

## Installing

* GZDoom v3.7.0 or higher is required to play this mod. Avoid v3.3.0 as it has an ACS bug that causes performance issues.
DRPG's launcher is the recommended method. Found here: https://github.com/Forevener/DRPGSEL/releases
It can download the mod for you and get it launched easy!

Manually:
https://github.com/Sumwunn/DoomRPG 
- The mod itself, click "Clone or download" -> "Download ZIP", extract it, then read the wiki for help.

## Compatible mods

- DoomRL Arsenal - [1.1] [MP-B7.0].
- LegenDoom v2.5.
- Colourful Hell v0.96b.
- Custom version of Jimmy's Jukebox Instant Randomizer has been included which allows DRPG's map events and Outpost music to play.

## Notes

I hope my fork has achieved some stability at least, I haven't had any crashes in a while so that's nice but testing for total stability isn't possible.
- Only OpenGL renderer works properly, all others will crash in outpost, not sure why.
- Consider all mods incompatible with DRPG unless stated otherwise.
- Why "SE" you ask? It just means "Sumwunn's Edition". It's just for differential proposes.
- If you wish to submit a PR, please make sure your changes haven't affected the stability of DRPG itself. DRPG is very sensitive creature. Must be handled gently. Also please use the GDCC version listed in Links.txt.
- Refer to Links.txt for all required tools for compiling.
- I will try to keep mod compatibilty updated as fast as I can.
- I (Sumwunn) am personally not comfortable with making any gameplay related changes (balance and stuff) so 99% of the time you will just see bugfixes from me.
- I'm just a fan of DoomRPG and want to keep it functioning. I'm not experienced, and very much learning as I go, so feel free to offer any comments. I'm also looking at the TODO list and seeing which I can accomplish. Starting with the small tasks of course!
- Probably forgot something.
