## Fork overview
Combines DoomRPG + Doom RogueLite Arsenal and puts a soulslike spin on it.

When you die you keep all your items and level progression. Instead you lose all your 'credit/ranks' ie souls. You will respawn back at the start of the level togther with all items/monsters. A tombstone is dropped where you died, retrieve it to get back your lost credits.

## Design Notes
* Encourage aggression. Health drops from dead monsters. The lower your health the more likely its drops.
* Drop important credits to encourage you to keep playing to retrieve it.
* You will die alot, but you can upgrade your stats to keep you going for longer.
